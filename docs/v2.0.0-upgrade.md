# V2.0.0 Upgrade

## ⚠️ Breaking change v2.0.0 (after v1.1.4) ⚠️
A breaking change was introduced _after_ version `v1.1.4` of this demostore FE which removed complex automation rules. In order for your demostore to work, you need the following:

1) Automation should use latest automation from [dc-demostore-automation](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-automation) using the lastest version of [dc-demostore-cli](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-cli)
2) Latest version of the dc-demostore-core FE from [dc-demostore-core](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-core)

### Recommended Upgrade path
This path assumes that you already have an Amplience Dynamic Content account with content and a deployed URL in Vercel.

1) Get latest version of dc-demostore-cli from npm

  `npm update @amplience/dc-demostore-cli` or if you installed globally `npm update @amplience/dc-demostore-cli -g`

Once updated you can validate you are on the latest version by running the following command and checking that it matches the latest release on this github page:

```
demostore --version
```

2) Clean your Amplience Dynamic Content account to start from a blank canvas

  `demostore cleanup -c -a`

3) Import from latest automation set

  `demostore import -l`

  See [import](../README.md#import) for details needed to update your front end

4) Update your front end [dc-demostore-core](https://github.com/amplience/dc-demostore-core) to the latest version and deploy using the right environment variables

### Staying on an older version
Deployed versions will continue to work if you are not changing anything.
